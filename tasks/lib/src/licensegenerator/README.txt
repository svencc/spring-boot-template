1. First run maven (plugin) goal license:aggregate-download-licenses
(we want the generated /target/generated-resources/licenses.xml file!)

2. Then execute App.java in /licensegenerator/main/java/com/stihl/licensegenerator/App.java
   
3. Result is written to: /gen-license-file.txt      <<<---(you want that)
